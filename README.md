# Easily Form Groups
Group-Finder allows students to ability to register groups (partial or full), and for students without groups to join prexisting groups. Being a fully remote course, it can be difficult for students to find groupmates and causes unnecessary stress. With the ability to form groups with a click of a button, students can be more successful in their course.

# Running Group-Finder
Group-Finder is broken up into two halves - front and back end.
